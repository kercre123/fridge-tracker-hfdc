# Hunger Free Dallas County fridge tracker software

This software is meant to serve as an endpoint for ESP8266 community-fridge-trackers.

## Overview

-	"Fridge Grids" (ESP8266 trackers) make a "status" request to the server when they first turn on
	-	They get added to a fridgeList.json
	-	They send status updates every ~5 minutes
	-	Every status update is logged as CSV to ./webroot/statusLogs/`name`.csv
-	When their distance sensors detect an open fridge door, they will begin a timer. When the door is closed, the timer stops and an "open" request is made
	-	Every open requests is logged as CSV to ./webroot/openLogs/`name`.csv
-	Every request also includes a temperature and humidity reading of the inside of the fridge
-	It hosts a basic data-viewing site (at /)
	-	A basic dropdown is given and you can view:
		-	How many times a certain fridge has been opened
		-	How long it has been in an opened state
		-	A (basic) chart
		-	Links to download the raw CSV files
-	There is preliminary support for sending emails to owners of community fridges whenever contact is lost
	-	A timer is made for each fridge
	-	A fridge is considered down if no status update has been sent in more than 30 minutes

## Why

Community fridges are obtained partially through the help of grants from the county. Having usage data for the fridges is very useful in applying for these grants.
